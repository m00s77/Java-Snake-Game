# Java Snake Game

This is a classic snake game that has a lot more that can be done but it has the main idea of the game.

The objective was to play a little bit with paintComponent() (Swing method) and movements through ActionListener. 

Of course, there are several other alternatives but that was not the idea.

It is a nice game to practice and do a lot more as HighScore, Background images, Sound, Start Menu, etc...   maybe next time!
