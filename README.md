# Java Snake Game

![](https://github.com/m00s77/Java-Snake-Game/blob/main/image/print.png)


This is a classic snake game that has a lot more that can be done but it has the main idea of the game.

Pause was implemented as also restart when the game is over. 

The objective was to play a little bit with paintComponent() (Swing) and movements through ActionListener. 

It is a nice game to practice and do a lot more as HighScore, Background images, Sound, Start Menu, etc...   maybe next time!
